                                    If you're looking to get started on investments or diversify your portfolio, then pre-vetted, low-risk investment opportunities are regularly available on Investify to help you grow your money.

                                    Your Safelock acts as your sub-account so that you can transfer and lock funds from your Piggybank wallet or your debit card for at least 10 days, without access to these funds until maturity.
                                    
                                    The SafeLock feature is one step further towards curbing the temptation to touch money that you have put aside as your savings.</p>

                                <h3>How is piggyvest able to afford Higher Returns?</h3>
                                <p>Our operational costs are relatively low - we do not operate multiple branches or hire a lot of staff to manage operations. We are also able to negotiate premium rates due to volumes. 

                                    All saved funds are warehoused with and managed by AIICO Capital, the leading asset management company in Nigeria, registered and licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which is extremely safe and guaranteed. A portion of the proceeds is then passed on to users as interests on their savings.</p>

                                <p>A Flex Naira account is a flexible savings wallet where interests earned on all other PiggyVest wallets are paid. </p>
                                <p>You earn an interest of 8% per annum on funds in your flex account but this is subject to a minimum of 4 withdrawals in a month.

                                    If you withdraw more than 4 times a month from your Flex account, you lose all your accrued interest on your Flex savings for that month.</p>
                                <p>Additionally, you can fund your Piggybank, Target, Safelock, Flex Dollar or Investify using funds in your Flex.

                                <p>On your free withdrawal days, you can also withdraw from your PiggyBank savings to your Flex Account.
